                <h2>Understanding Cash on Delivery (COD)</h2>
                <p>A cash-on-delivery transaction can take different forms and may affect a companyâ€™s 
                    accounting in different ways. Public companies are required to use the accrual accounting 
                    method under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

                    With accrual accounting, a company recognizes revenue at the time of the transaction and 
                    records the payment in accounts receivable if the payment is deferred. Private companies 
                    can use either accrual or cash accounting. In cash accounting, the company must wait to record 
                    the transaction as revenue until payment is received.
                    
                    If a customer is dealing with a merchant in person, and the customer makes a purchase 
                    from readily available inventory, payment is collected at the time of sale as a form of 
                    cash on delivery. Under the accrual accounting method, this leads to a shorter accounts 
                    receivable period and higher efficiency.</p>
                    <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cash on Delivery</h2>
                    <h3>Advantages</h3>
                    <p>For many businesses, in-person COD facilitates the immediate payment of goods and 
                        services. This is a significant accounting advantage because it can greatly shorten 
                        the days receivable for a business.

                        COD typically has shorter timeframes to delivery than standard invoicing. This 
                        is beneficial since the customer is required by an intermediary to pay at delivery. 
                        With COD shipping, customers have time to collect the money to make a full payment.</p>
                        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                        <p>The cons of COD for businesses are that there is a greater risk that goods will 
                            be refused on delivery, and there are costs involved in returning items. For 
                            buyers, it may be more difficult to return items if they have already paid for 
                            them at delivery. A seller may be reluctant or under no obligation to accept 
                            returns, even if the consumer is unhappy with the goods.</p>
